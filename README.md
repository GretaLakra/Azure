# Lift and Shift Azure Resource Manager

Lucerne Publishing is one of the largest English-language publishers in the world. With nearly 200 years of history, Lucerne has published some of the world's foremost authors, including Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, Newbery Medal and Caldecott Medal winners. Lucerne is consistently at the forefront of innovation, using digital technology to create unique reading and viewing experiences and expand the reach of its authors and documentary producers.

Lucerne is starting a three-year project to move most of its data center footprint to the cloud. "We are convinced that cloud implementations will give us cost savings and more importantly, deliver operational flexibility," says Greg Vernon, head of infrastructure and enterprise operations at Lucerne. "Like every other business, we are under constant pressure to do more with less. We believe that cloud computing will be substantially cheaper over time than in-house data centers."

## Target audience

- Infrastructure Architect 

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will help a global publisher architect a solution to migrate two on-premises applications into Azure. Because of the desire to not change the existing applications, this will involve moving the application and its dependencies onto Azure IaaS VMs, using other Azure services where appropriate. There are many questions and concerns the customer has, and they will look to the student to answer these and provide the end-state design and the high-level steps to get there with minimal end-user impact and risk.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to migrate and enable easy deployment for lift-and-shift capabilities. In addition, you will learn to build and deploy complex infrastructure solutions with Azure Resource Manager templates, work with Azure Automation Desired State Configuration (DSC) for deploying server configurations, as well as scale existing templatized deployments leveraging VM Scale Sets.

### Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn how to migrate two existing, but quite different, applications to Azure. You will create both an effective and cost-efficient Azure design, and plan how to achieve migration to that design within the constraints set by the business. You will need to consider a range of different approaches and tools to meet the differing migration needs of each application.

At the end of this whiteboard design session you will be better able to migrate and enable easy deployment for lift-and-shift capabilities. In addition, you will learn to build and deploy complex infrastructure solutions with Azure Resource Manager templates, work with Azure Automation Desired State Configuration (DSC) for deploying server configurations, as well as scale existing templatized deployments leveraging VM Scale Sets.

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to author an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template that can be used to deploy infrastructure such as virtual machine, storage, and networking. This lab will also teach the you how to deploy virtual machines that are automatically configured by the Azure Automation Desired State Configuration (DSC) service.

By the end of this lab, you will be better able to migrate and enable easy deployment for lift-and-shift capabilities. In addition, you will learn to build and deploy complex infrastructure solutions with Azure Resource Manager templates, work with Azure Automation Desired State Configuration (DSC) for deploying server configurations, as well as scale existing templatized deployments leveraging VM Scale Sets.

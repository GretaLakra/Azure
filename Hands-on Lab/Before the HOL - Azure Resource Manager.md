## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 15 minutes

Prior to attending the lab, follow the instructions below to create a
lab environment using an Azure Virtual Machine and download the needed
files for the lab exercise.

### Task 1: Create a virtual machine for your lab environment 

1.  Launch a browser using incognite or in-private mode, and navigate to
    <https://portal.azure.com>. Once prompted, login with your Microsoft
    Azure credentials. If prompted, choose whether your account is an
    organization account or just a Microsoft Account.

2.  Click on +NEW, and in the search box, type in Visual Studio
    Community 2017, and press enter. Click
    the Visual Studio Community 2017 image running on Windows Server
    2016 and with the latest update.

3.  In the returned search results, click the image name

    ![In the Everything blade, Visual Studio Community 2017 is typed in the Search field. Under Name, Visual Studio Community on Windows Server 2016 is circled.](images/Setup/2018-08-15-10-04-24.png "Everything blade")

4.  In the Marketplace solution blade, click **Create**

5.  Set the following configuration on the Basics tab, and select **OK**:

    -   Name: **LABVM**

    -   VM disk type: **Premium SSD**

    -   User name: **demouser**

    -   Password: **demo\@pass123**

    -   Subscription: **If you have multiple subscriptions choose the subscription to execute your labs in**

    -   Resource Group: **OPSLABRG**

    -   Location: **Choose the closest Azure region to you**

6.  Choose the **DS1\_V2 Standard** instance size on the Size blade.


7.  On the Settings blade, choose **RDP (3389)** on the Select public inbound ports dropdown.

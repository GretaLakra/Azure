## Exercise 1: Configure Automation Account

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will create and configure an Azure Automation
Account in the Azure portal before configuring and deploying the
resources of your ARM template.

### Task 1: Create Automation Account

1.  Browse to the Azure portal and authenticate at
    <https://portal.azure.com/>

2.  Click + **Create Resource** and type **Automation** in the search box. Choose **Automation** from the results.

3.  Click **Create** on the Automation blade to display the **Add Automation Account** blade. Specify the following information, and click **Create**:
    
    ![In the Add Automation Account blade, the Name field is set to Automation-Acct. The Resource Group field is set to Automation\_RG, and the Create new radio button is selected. The Location field is set to Location nearest you. TheCreate Azure Run As account is set to Yes.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image17.png "Add Automation Account blade")

### Task 2: Add an Azure Automation credential

1.  The CloudShopSQL DSC configuration requires a credential object to
    access the local administrator account on the virtual machine.
    Within the Azure Automation Account click **Credentials**
    in the **SHARED RESOURCES** section.

    ![In the Shared Resources section, Credentials is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/2018-08-15-12-10-10.png "Shared Resources section")

2.  Click the **Add a credential** button

    ![Screenshot of the Add a credential button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image22.png "Add a credential button")

3.  Specify the following properties and confirm creation to continue:

    a.  **Name**: SQLLocalAdmin

    b.  **User Name**: demouser

    c.  **Password & Confirm**: demo\@pass123

    ![The fields in the New Credential dialog box are set to the previously listed settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image23.png "New Credential dialog box")

Important: It is important to use the exact name for the credential,
because one of the scripts you upload in the next step references the
name directly.


### Task 3: Upload DSC Configurations into Automation Account

1.  Click **Resource groups \> Automation\_RG \> Automation-Acct**, and click the **State configuration (DSC)** menu.

    ![On the Automation account page, in the left pane, State configuration \(DSC\) is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/2018-08-15-12-17-53.png "Automation account page")

2.  Select the **Configurations** tab.

    ![On the State configuration blade, the Configurations tab is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/2018-08-15-12-21-50.png "Configurations tab")

3.  Click **+Add** button to upload **C:\\Hackathon\\CloudShopSQL.ps1** and **C:\\Hackathon\\CloudShopWeb.ps1**.

    ![In the Import configuration pane, CloudShopSQL.ps1 is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/2018-08-15-12-36-34.png "Import configuration pane")   ![In the Import configuration pane, CloudShopWeb.ps1 is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/2018-08-15-12-41-04.png "Import configuration pane")

4.  After importing the .ps1 files, click the **CloudShopSQL** DSC
    Configuration and click **Compile** on the toolbar (click **Yes** on
    the Start Compilation Job blade). Do the same for **CloudShopWeb**.
    
    ![In the DSC Configurations pane, under Name, CloudShopSQL is circled. In the CloudShopSQL pane, the Compile button is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image20.png "DSC Configurations CloudShopSQL panes")


## Exercise 2: Define the network foundation

Duration: 15 minutes

Your first ARM template task is to create a virtual network template
using Visual Studio and deploy it to your Azure account.

### Task 1: Deploy a virtual network with a template

1.  Open Visual Studio. The shortcut should be available on the desktop,
    and if it is not, click the Windows icon in the bottom left corner,
    and type in Visual Studio. You should see the start icon.

2.  Choose **File**, and **New Project**. Then, choose **Cloud**
    followed by **Azure Resource Group**.

3.  Name the project **ARMHackathon**, specify **C:\\Hackathon** for the
    location, and click **OK**

    ![In the New Project window, in the left pane, under Installed, the tree-view is expanded as follows: Templates\\Visual C\#\\Cloud. In the right pane, Azure Resource Group is circled, and called out (1). At the bottom, the Name field is set to ARMHackathon and is called out (2), as is the OK button (3).](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image24.png "New Project window")

4.  On the Select Azure Template dialog box, choose **Blank Template**, and click **OK**

    ![In the Select Azure Template window, Blank Template is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image25.png "Select Azure Template window")

5.  In the **Solution Explorer**, open the **azuredeploy.json** under
    the solution

    ![In the Solution Explorer window, under ARMHackathon, azuredeploy.json is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image26.png "Solution Explorer window")

6.  The file should contain four different sections: parameters,
    variables, resources, and outputs. On the left side, a new window
    called **JSON Outline** should have been opened as well.

    ![In the ARMHackathon Visual Studio window, JSON Outline displays in the left pane. In the right pane, the azuredeploy.json file displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image27.png "Visual Studio window")

    > Note: If this was not the case, go to the View menu, select Other Windows, and choose JSON Outline. The window should look like the following image.

7.  On the **JSON Outline** window, click **Add Resource** in the upper-left corner or right-click the **resources**, and choose **Add New Resource**.

    ![Screenshot of the JSON Outline button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image28.png "JSON Outline button")

8.  On the **Add Resource** dialog box, choose **Virtual Network**,
    enter **hackathonVnet** in the **Name** field, and click **Add**

    ![In the left pane of the Add Resource dialog box, Virtual Network is circled. In the right, Create a virtual network pane, the Name field is set to hackathonVnet.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image29.png "Add Resource dialog box")

9.  Go to the **azuredeploy.json** file, and inspect its content. Review
    the **variables** section. It should look like the following file.
    ```  
    "variables": {
      "hackathonVnetPrefix": "10.0.0.0/16",
      "hackathonVnetSubnet1Name": "Subnet-1",
      "hackathonVnetSubnet1Prefix": "10.0.0.0/24",
      "hackathonVnetSubnet2Name": "Subnet-2",
      "hackathonVnetSubnet2Prefix": "10.0.1.0/24"
    },
    ```

10. Change the name of **Subnet-1** to **FrontEndNet** as well as the
    name of **Subnet-2** to **DatabaseNet**
    ```
    "hackathonVnetSubnet1Name": "FrontEndNet",
    "hackathonVnetSubnet2Name": "DatabaseNet",
    ```

11. Deploy the template by **right-clicking** the **ARMHackathon**
    project and choosing **Deploy** **\>** **New**

    ![In the Solution Explorer window, ARMHackathon is selected, and in the right-click menu, New is called out (1), and in its right-click menu, Deploy is called out(2).](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image30.png "Solution Explorer window")

12. If you did not sign in to your Microsoft Azure account already, you will be asked to do so now

13. Fill in the email address associated with the Azure account, and click **Continue**

    ![The Sign in to Visual Studio window displays with the User name field obscured.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image31.png "Sign in to Visual Studio window")

14. You might have to choose between a work/school account and a
    Microsoft account. Microsoft account refers to a Live ID account.
    Depending on what kind of account you have, you should choose one or
    the other.

15. Enter your password, and click **Sign In**

    ![The Sign in to Visual Studio window displays with the username field obscured, and this time the Password field displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image32.png "Sign in to Visual Studio window ")

16. If you have several subscriptions, choose the one that you want your VNet to be deployed to, and on the Resource group, choose **Create New**

    ![In the Deploy to Resource Group window, the Resource group field is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image33.png "Deploy to Resource Group window")

17. On the Create Resource Group dialog box, accept the default value for the name. For the location, choose the **closest location to you**, and click **Create**

    ![In the Create Resource Group window, the Create button is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image34.png "Create Resource Group window")

18. When you are back on the Deploy to Resource Group dialog box, click
    **Deploy**. After about a minute, your virtual network will be
    deployed to Azure.

    ![In the Deploy to Resource Group window, the Deploy button is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image35.png "Deploy to Resource Group window")

19. View the created resource group and virtual network in the Azure
    Management Portal by clicking **Resource Groups** and clicking the
    **ARMHackathon**

    ![Screenshot of the Resource groups button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image36.png "Resource groups button")

    ![In the Azure Management Portal, in the ARMHackathon resource group, Overview is selected in the left pane. In the right pane, under Essentials, under Name, hackathonVnet is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image37.png "Azure Management Portal")

    > Note: If the resource group was created but the virtual network was not, redeploy the template once more from Visual Studio.

    You should see an indication of a successful deployment in the **Output** screen.
    ![In the Output window, in the output for ARMHackathon, ProvisioningState Succeeded is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image38.png "Output window")

20. To verify the new network was created, within the Azure portal,
    navigate to **Virtual Networks**. Your new network should be listed
    there.

    ![In the Virtual Networks window, in the left pane, Subnets is selected. In the right pane, under Name, a callout arrow points to DatabaseNet.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image39.png "Virtual Networks window")

## Exercise 3: Extend with Compute

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will continue the work you started in the previous
task by creating a storage account and adding virtual machines for the
web application and database followed by configuring the machines for
the roles.

### Task 1: Add an Azure storage account

1.  On the **JSON Outline** window, click **Add Resource** in the upper-left corner, or right-click the **resources** and choose **Add New Resource**.

    ![Screenshot of the Add New Resource button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image28.png "Add New Resource button")

2.  Add a new **Storage Account** resource to the template named ***hackstorage***

    > Note: The template generated in the Azure SDK appends a unique value (13 characters in length) to the storage account name. Storage account names must not exceed 24 characters. Ensure the name specified is 11 characters or less in length.

    ![In the Add New Resource window, in the left pane, Storage Account is selected. In the right, Create a Storage account pane, hackstorage is typed into the Name field.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image40.jpg "Add Resource window")

3. Click **Add** to add the storage account to the template

### Task 2: Add a virtual machine and configure as a web server

1.  Add a new **Windows Virtual Machine** called **hackathonVM**, and
    choose ***hackstorage*** as the Storage Account and **FrontEndNet**
    subnet as the Virtual network/subnet. The **FrontEndNet** is the
    value of **hackathonVnetSubnet1Name** variable.

    > Note: The storage account will be changed later to use a new feature called Managed Disks.

    ![The fields in the Windows Virtual Machine window are set to the previously mentioned settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image44.jpg "Windows Virtual Machine window")

2.  Locate the Parameter **hackathonVMWindowsOSVersion**

    ![Screenshot of the hackathonVMWindowsOSVersion parameter.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image45.png "hackathonVMWindowsOSVersion parameter")

3.  Replace the code between the start { and stop } brackets with the
    updated code below to allow for the use of Windows Server 2016
    Offerings. Ensure you do not remove either of the { } brackets in
    the process.

    ![In the JSON window, code displays. This code is the same as the following code, except for 2012-R2-Datacenter, which in the next code is changed to 2016-Datacenter](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image46.png "JSON window")

    Replace the code block with the code below:
    ```
       "type": "string",
       "defaultValue": "2016-Datacenter",
       "allowedValues": [
       "2016-Datacenter"
        ]  
    ```

4.  A **Network Interface** named ***hackathonVMNic*** was automatically
    added to the configuration when the virtual machine resource was
    added to connect the virtual machine to the virtual network. Add a
    Public IP address called ***hackathonPublicIP*** to the
    **hackathonVMNic**. This will allow you to connect to the machine
    using remote desktop client or to access the web server.

    ![In the Add Resource window, in the left pane, Public IP Address is circled. In the right, Create a Public IP Address pane, the Name field is set to hackathonPublicIP, and is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image47.png "Add Resource window")

    > Note: If you inspect the JSON for the NIC, you'll notice that the ipConfigurations were modified to refer to the public IP address just added!

5.  In the JSON outline pane, select the hackathonVM object
    ![Select the hackathonVM object](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/hackathonvm.png "hackathonVM")

6.  Visual Studio should have highlighted the JSON that represents the VM object.  Within this JSON code, locate 2 sections of code:

    First, find:
    ```
    "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
    ```
    Change to:
    ```
    "apiVersion": "2017-03-30",
    ```
    Next, find:

    ```
          "osDisk": {
            "name": "hackathonVMOSDisk",
            "vhd": {
              "uri": "[concat(reference(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', variables('hackstorageName')), '2016-01-01').primaryEndpoints.blob, variables('hackathonVMStorageAccountContainerName'), '/', variables('hackathonVMOSDiskName'), '.vhd')]"
            },
            "caching": "ReadWrite",
            "createOption": "FromImage"
          }
    ```
    Replace the code block with the code below:

    ```
            "osDisk": {
                "createOption": "FromImage"
            }
    ```

    This step has changed the VM to use **managed disks** instead of unmanaged disks.

7.  Next you will add the PowerShell DSC Extension to the
    **azuredeploy.json** file. This will register the VM with Azure
    Automation DSC Extension.

    ![In the PowerShell DSC Extension window, the Name field is set to hackathonDSC, and is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image48.png "PowerShell DSC Extension window")

8.  Change the Type Handler from 2.9 to **2.76**, and make sure that
    autoUpgradeMinorVersion is **false**

    ![The PowerShell DSC code block has the typehandlerVersion at 2.19, and the autoUpgradeMinorVersion as false. Both values are circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image49.png "PowerShell DSC code ")


9.  Find the settings code within the PowerShell DSC section you just
    added, and replace it with this code (make sure you do not remove
    the protectedSettings block):

    ![The PowerShell DSC code section is similar to, but not the same as the following code.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image50.png "PowerShell DSC section")
    ```
            "settings": {
              "modulesUrl": "https://cloudworkshop.blob.core.windows.net/arm-hackathon/RegistrationMetaConfigV2.zip",
              "configurationFunction": "RegistrationMetaConfigV2.ps1\\RegistrationMetaConfigV2",
              "Properties": [

                },
                "TypeName": "System.Management.Automation.PSCredential"
               },
               {
                "Name": "RegistrationUrl",
                "Value": "[parameters('registrationUrl')]",

                "TypeName": "System.String"
               }
              ]
           },
    ```
8.  Next in the protectedSettings section, delete the
        "configurationUrlSasToken" line; replacing it with this code:
    ```
    "Items": {
        "registrationKeyPrivate": "[parameters('registrationKey')]"
     }
    ```

       "metadata": {
        "description": "Time stamp MM/dd/YYYY H:mm:ss"
       }
      }
    ```

10. In the "**variables**" section, change the value of
    hackathonVMVmSize\" to \"Standard\_DS1\_v2"

    ![The Variables section is as follows: \"hackathonVMmSize\" :\"Standard\_DS1\_v2\",](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image54.png "Variables section")

11. Save your changes to the **azuredeploy.json** template file

### Task 3: Add a Windows virtual machine for the database server

1.  Add another virtual machine to the template by clicking **Add Resource** and next, selecting **Windows Virtual Machine**

    ![Screenshot of the Windows Virtual Machine icon.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image55.png "Windows Virtual Machine icon")

2.  Name this virtual machine resource **hackathonSqlVM**, and reference
    the parameters **hackStorage** and **hackathonVnetSubnet2Name**
    respectively

    ![The Windows Virtual Machine window fields are set to the previously mentioned settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image56.jpg "Windows Virtual Machine window")

3.  Navigate to the **variables** section, and find the following
    variables:

    ![Screenshot of the Variables section, with the following variables:hackathonSqlVMImagePublisherhackathonSqlVMImageOffer](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image57.png "Variables section")

4.  Modify the following **hackathonSqlVMImagePublisher** and
    **hackathonSqlVMImageOffer** variables to the following SQL Server
    image values:

    ```
    "hackathonSqlVMImagePublisher": "MicrosoftSQLServer",
    "hackathonSqlVMImageOffer": "SQL2016SP1-WS2016",
    ```

5.  Find the **hackathonSqlVMWindowsOSVersion** parameter

    ![Screenshot of the hackathonSqlVMWindowsOSVersion Parameter.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image58.png "hackathonSqlVMWindowsOSVersion Parameter")

6.  Replace the **hackathonSqlVMWindowsOSVersion** parameter with the following:
    ```
    "hackathonSqlVMSKU": {
          "type": "string",
          "defaultValue": "Web",
          "allowedValues": [
            "Web",
            "Standard",
            "Enterprise"
          ]
        }	
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the hackathonSqlVMWindowsOSVersion Parameter section, with hackathonSQLVMSKU highlighted. The code in the parameter section is the same as the previous code block.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image59.png "hackathonSqlVMWindowsOSVersion Parameter")

7.  Click the **hackathonSqlVM** resource to move to its properties

    ![Under Resources, under hackathonVM, hackathonSqlVM is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image60.png "Resources section")

8.  Update the **SKU** property to point to the new parameter: **hackathonSqlVMSKU**

    ```
    "sku": "[parameters('hackathonSqlVMSKU')]", 
    ```

    ![Screenshot of a code window, with hackathonSqlVMSKU selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image61.png "code window")

9.  Navigate to the **parameters** section of the template, and add a
    new parameter called **vmSizeSQL** to define the size of the virtual
    machine

    > **Tip:** Do not forget the preceding comma.
    ```
    "vmSizeSql": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "Standard_DS1_v2",
      "allowedValues": [
      	  "Standard_DS1_v2",       
           "Standard_DS2_v2",
           "Standard_DS3_v2",
           "Standard_DS4_v2",
           "Standard_D5_v2"
        ]
    }
    ```

    ![In the code window, an \"Add Comma\" callout points to the following code:},](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image62.png "code window")

10. Navigate to the **resources** section for the **hackathonSqlVM**.
    Find the **hardwareProfile** section, and replace the reference to
    the **vmSize** variable to a reference to the new **vmSizeSql**
    parameter:
    ```
    "vmSize": "[parameters('vmSizeSql')]"
    ```
    ![In the code window, the previously mentioned new vmSizeSAL parameter is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image63.png "code window")

11. For storage, the SQL Server virtual machine will use managed disks to simplify manageability. This requires the API version of the SQL VM resource to be updated. In the Resource Explorer view, click hackathonSqlVM and in the code window update the API version value to match the following: 

    ```
    "apiVersion": "2017-03-30",
    ```

12. Modify OS Disk for managed disks by removing the name and vhd property inside the osDisk section. The osDisk section should look like the following:

    ```
    "osDisk": {
        "caching": "ReadWrite",
        "createOption": "FromImage"
    }
    ```

13. To deploy two 1TB data disks, add the following section to the
    properties, storage profile section of the **hackathonSqlVM** (right
    after osDisk)

    > **Tip:** Do not forget to add a comma at the end of the osDisk section.
    ```
    "dataDisks": [
        {
            "diskSizeGB": 1023,
            "lun": 0,
            "createOption": "Empty"
        },
        {
            "diskSizeGB": 1023,
            "lun": 1,
            "createOption": "Empty"
        }
    ]
    ```

    Your code change should look like this: 

    ![In the code window, code is circled naming the dataDisks datadisk1, setting its disk size at 1023 GB](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image65.png "code window")

14. Next you will add the PowerShell DSC Extension named
    **hackathonDSCSQL** to the **azuredeploy.json** file for the SQL VM.
    This will register the VM with Azure Automation DSC Extension.**\**

    ![In the PowerShell DSC Extension window, in the Name field, hackathonDSCSQL is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image66.png "PowerShell DSC Extension")

15. Create a new parameter that will be different for the SQL VM. In the
    **parameters** section, add the following code immediately after the
    existing **nodeConfigurationName** parameter.
    ```
       "sqlnodeConfigurationName": {
          "type": "string",
          "metadata": {
            "description": "Name of configuration to SQL"
          }
        },
    ```

    ![In the code window, the previous mentioned code block is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image67.png "code window")

16. Save your changes to the **azuredeploy.json** template file

17. Navigate to the hackathonDscSQL resource

    ![In the Resources tree-view, the following path is expanded: resources\\hackathonVM\\hackathonSqlVM\\hackathonDscSQL.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image68.png "Resources tree-view")

18. Change the Type Handler from **2.9 to 2.19**, and make sure that
    **autoUpgradeMinorVersion** is false

    ![In the Code window, the typeHandlerVersion of 2.19 is circled, and the autoUpgradeMinorVersion of false is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image49.png "Code window")

    > Note: This is due to a bug in PowerShell DSC at the time of this
    writing. It may be resolved by now.

19. Find the settings code within the PowerShell DSC section you just
    added, and replace it with this code:

    ![Code detailed in the following code section is circled in the code window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image69.png "Code window")
    ```
             "settings": {

                "Value": "[parameters('configurationModeFrequencyMins')]",
                "TypeName": "System.Int32"
               },
               {
                "Name": "RefreshFrequencyMins",
                "Value": "[parameters('refreshFrequencyMins')]",
                "TypeName": "System.Int32"
               },
               {
                "Name": "RebootNodeIfNeeded",
                "Value": "[parameters('rebootNodeIfNeeded')]",
                "TypeName": "System.Boolean"
               },
               {
                "Name": "ActionAfterReboot",
                "Value": "[parameters('actionAfterReboot')]",
                "TypeName": "System.String"
               },
               {
                "Name": "AllowModuleOverwrite",

                "TypeName": "System.String"
               }
              ]
           },
    ```

20. Next, in the **protectedSettings** section, delete the
    "**configurationUrlSasToken**" line; replacing it with this code:
    ```
    "Items": {
        "registrationKeyPrivate": "[parameters('registrationKey')]"
     }
    ```

    Before:

    ![The displayed Code section has a parameter of \_artifactsLocationSasToken, which will be replaced with parameters(\'registrationKey\')](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image51.png "Code section")

    After:

    ![The displayed Code section has a parameter of parameters(\'registrationKey\') which replaced \_artifactsLocationSasToken.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image52.png "Code section")

21.  In the paramters section of the JSON outline, delete _artifactsLocation and _artifactsLocationSasToken:

    ![Delete artifactsLocation](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image52.png/artifactslocation.png)

    ![Delete artifactsLocationSasToken](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image52.png/artifactsLocationsastoken.png) 

22. Save your changes to the **azuredeploy.json** template file

### Task 4: Deploy your updated template to Azure

1.  Before deploying your updated template, you should take note of your
    Automation key and registration URL. In the Azure portal, click
    **Resource groups \> Automation\_RG \> Automation-Acct**. Then, in
    the Account Settings area, click the **Keys** icon.

    ![In the Automation Account pane, under Account Settings, Keys is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image70.png "Automation Account pane")

2.  The information you will need to deploy your template is on the **Manage Keys** blade to the right. When doing the deployment from within Visual Studio, a Key needs to be provided. The **Primary Access Key** can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the button next to the Key on this blade.

    ![In the Manage Keys blade, the copy button for Primary Access Key is called out with an arrow.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image71.png "Manage Keys blade")

3.  Using this same process, the **URL** can also be copied to use with
    Visual Studio

    ![In the In the Manage Keys blade, the copy button for the URL field is called out with an arrow.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image72.png "Manage Keys blade")

4.  You will also need the name of your Node Configurations you uploaded
    using the portal during Exercise 1. To find these, click the State configuration (DSC) tile on the Azure Automation Blade. Select the Configurations tab, click the name of each configuration to find the Node Name.

    ![In the DSC Configurations pane, under Name, CloudShopSQL is circled. Under CloudShopSQL, under Node Configuration, under Name, CloudShopSQL.SQLSERVER is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/2018-08-15-13-47-32.png "DSC Configurations window")

5.  Within Visual Studio, create a new deployment (*specify the same
    Resource group as before ARMHackathon)*
    
    ![In Visual Studio, ArmHackathon is selected. In its right-click menu, New Deployment is selected, and the right-click menu for New Deployment has Deploy selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image74.png "Visual Studio")

6.  On the **Deploy to Resource Group** dialog box, click **Edit Parameters**, and populate the empty values:

    ![In the Deploy to Resource Group dialog box, the Edit Parameters button is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image75.png "Deploy to Resource Group dialog box")

    -   hackathonVMName: **armweb**

    -   hackathonVMAdminUserName: **demouser**

    -   hackathonVMAdminPassword: **demo\@pass123**

    -   hackathonPublicIPDnsName: **Choose a unique looking DNS name (must
        be lowercase)**

    -   registrationKey: **Automation account key**

    -   registrationUrl: **Automation registration URL**

    -   nodeConfigurationName: **CloudShopWeb.WebServer**

    -   sqlnodeConfigurationName: **CloudShopSQL.SQLSERVER**

    -   rebootNodeIfNeeded: **True**

    -   allowModuleOverwrite: **True**

    -   configurationMode: **ApplyAndMonitor**

    -   configurationModeFrequencyMins: **15**

    -   refreshFrequencyMins: **30**

    -   actionAfterReboot: ContinueConfiguration

    -   timestamp: **\<enter current value in format like screenshot below\>**

    -   \_artifactsLocation: **\<Auto-generated\>**

    -   \_artifactsLocationSasToken: **\<Auto-generated\>**

    -   hackathonSQLVMName: **armsql**

    -   hackathonVMSQLAdminUserName: **demouser**

    -   hackathonVMSQLAdminPassword: **demo\@pass123**

    -   hackathonVMSQLSKU: **Web**

    -   vmsizeSQL: **Standard\_DS3\_v2**

    -   **Check: Save passwords as plain text in the parameters file**

    ![Fields in the Edit Parameters dialog box are set to the previously mentioned settings and values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image76.png "Edit Parameters dialog box")

    > Note: The deployment may take 20 to 30 minutes to complete.

    **Extension Troubleshooting Tip:** If you make a mistake with either of the
    Azure DSC extensions and need to redeploy, open the virtual machine in
    the portal. Under all settings, click extensions, and remove the failed
    extension before deploying. Then, in your Automation Account, under the
    DSC Nodes, unregister the node.

    > Note: The DSC configuration may take time to apply following the
    successful template deployment. Monitor this in the DSC Nodes section in
    the Automation Account properties. Wait to proceed until both nodes show
    as compliant.

7.  Launch the **Azure Management Portal** <http://portal.azure.com>,and navigate to the resource group you deployed to. Click the **virtual machine** for the web server. Then, click the **Public IP**.

    ![In the Resource group pane, the Public IP address (52.184.226.46) is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image77.png "Resource group pane")

8.  Copy the **IP address**, and navigate to it in the browser

    ![The Cloud Shop webpage displays, with a list of products from which to choose.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image78.png "Cloud Shop webpage")

## Exercise 4: Lock down the environment 

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy a network security group to restrict
the network attack surface for the deployment.

### Task 1: Restrict traffic to the web server

1.  Add the following at the beginning of the JSON template as the first
    item under the **resources** node. This will deploy the network
    security group resource and add a rule. Therefore, the only port
    open on the Public IP is port 80.

    ![The following code displays, with resources underlined, and the comment \"Insert new Line\" next to it: \"resources\": \[ { \"name\":\"hackathonVNet\",](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image80.png "code")

    ![The same code displays, but under resources, a line is inserted with the comment \"Paste Code Here.\"](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image81.png "code")
    ```
    {
     "apiVersion": "2016-03-30",
     "type": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups",
     "name": "hackathonNetworkSecurityGroup",
     "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
     "properties": {
      "securityRules": [
       {
        "name": "webrule",
        "properties": {
         "description": "This rule allows traffic in on port 80",
         "protocol": "Tcp",
         "sourcePortRange": "*",
         "destinationPortRange": "80",
         "sourceAddressPrefix": "INTERNET",
         "destinationAddressPrefix": "10.0.0.0/24",
         "access": "Allow",
         "priority": 100,
         "direction": "Inbound"
        }
       }
      ]
     }
    },
    ```

2.  Click the **hackathonVNet** resource to go to its configuration

    ![Under resources, hackathonVNet is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image82.png "hackathonVNet resource")

3.  Associate the network security group with the
    **hackathonVnetSubnet1Name** subnet by adding a comma at the end of
    the **addressPrefix** block and pasting in the
    **networkSecurityGroup** reference

    ```
    "networkSecurityGroup": {
       "id": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups', 'hackathonNetworkSecurityGroup')]"
     }
    ```

    ![A code window displays. A comma after networkSecurityGroup is called out (1). The previously mentioned code is circled and called out (2).](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image83.png "code window")

4.  Update the virtual network to have a dependency on the network security group

5.  Click the **hackathonVNet** resource to view the configuration

    ![Under resources, hackathonVNet is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image84.png "hackathonVNet resource")

6.  Change the **dependsOn** configuration to refer to the network security group

    ```
        "dependsOn": [
        "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups', 'hackathonNetworkSecurityGroup')]"
        ],
    ```

7.  Right-click the Visual Studio project, and select **Deploy** from
    the context menu followed by **New Deployment**. Click **Deploy** to
    update the existing deployment with the network security group.

8.  In the Portal, browse to the ARMHackathon Resource Group and locate
    the newly added Network Security Group

    ![Screenshot of hackathonNetworkSecurityGroup.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image85.png "hackathonNetworkSecurityGroup")

9.  To validate the network security group is working:

    -   Browse to the Public IP or DNS name of the web server. The site
        should load because traffic is allowed on port 80.

    -   Connect to the **armweb** virtual machine by clicking
        **Connect** in the preview portal. This should fail because port
        3389 is not allowed in.

### Task 2: Update the network security group to allow Windows Remote Desktop

1.  Add a new rule to the network security group to allow in traffic on
    port 3389 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by adding a comma at the end
    of the web rule and add the following code:
    ```
    {
     "name": "rdprule",
     "properties": {
      "description": "This rule allows traffic on port 3389 from the web",
      "protocol": "Tcp",
      "sourcePortRange": "*",
      "destinationPortRange": "3389",
      "sourceAddressPrefix": "INTERNET",
      "destinationAddressPrefix": "10.0.0.0/24",
      "access": "Allow",
      "priority": 200,
      "direction": "Inbound"
     }
    }
    ```

    ![A code window displays. A callout arrow points to a comma, and the previously mentioned code is circled below.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image87.png "code window")

2.  Perform another Deployment using Visual Studio to set the rule and
    test RDP connectivity again

3.  Open the Azure Preview Portal, and navigate to the resource group
    containing your deployment

4.  Click the **hackathonNetworkSecurityGroup** in the resources
    summary

5.  Examine the created rules

    ![This image contains the created Inbound and Outbound security rules.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image88.png "Inbound and outbound security rules.")

## Exercise 5: Scale out the deployment

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure the template to scale out the web
front-end using a scalable number of virtual machines and storage
accounts. For this, you will use the load balancer and the scale sets
feature.

### Task 1: Parameterize and scale out the environment 

1.  Add the following variables to the end of the **variables** section
    of the **azuredeploy.json** file:

**Tip:** Do not forget to put a comma after the previous variables.

![In the code window, an arrow points to a comma that precedes the code following this graphic.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image89.png "code window")
```
    "vmSSName": "webset",
    "publicIPAddressID": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses',variables('hackathonPublicIPName'))]",
    "lbName": "loadBalancer1",
    "lbID": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers',variables('lbName'))]",
    "lbFEName": "loadBalancerFrontEnd",
    "lbWebProbeName": "loadBalancerWebProbe",
    "lbBEAddressPool": "loadBalancerBEAddressPool",
    "lbFEIPConfigID": "[concat(variables('lbID'),'/frontendIPConfigurations/',variables('lbFEName'))]",
    "lbBEAddressPoolID": "[concat(variables('lbID'),'/backendAddressPools/',variables('lbBEAddressPool'))]",
    "lbWebProbeID": "[concat(variables('lbID'),'/probes/',variables('lbWebProbeName'))]"
```

2.  Add the following parameters to the end of the **parameters**
    section of the **azuredeploy.json** file (do not forget to add the
    comma after the last parameter)
    ```
      "instanceCount": {
       "type": "string",
       "metadata": {
        "description": "Number of VM instances"
       }
      }
    ```

    ![In the code window, a comma that precedes the code mentioned previous to this graphic, is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image90.png "code window")


3.  Add a new storage account resource using the copy function by pasting the following code as the first resource in the list

    ![The following code displays, with resources underlined, and a comment to \"insert code here:\" \"resources\": \[ {](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image91.png "Code ")
    ```
    {
     "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
     "name": "[concat(variables('StorageAccountPrefix')[copyIndex()],parameters('newStorageAccountSuffix'))]",
     "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
     "copy": {
      "name": "storageLoop",
      "count": 5
     },
     "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
     "properties": {
      "accountType": "[parameters('hackStorageType')]"
     }
    },
    ```

    > Note: This code will create five storage accounts. The virtual machine
    scale set will distribute the virtual machine disks across the storage
    accounts to ensure the VMs do not run out of IO capacity.

4.  Add a load balancer resource by pasting the following code as the first resource in the list.


    ![The following code displays, with resources underlined, and a comment to \"insert code here:\" \"resources\": \[{](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image91.png "code")

    > Note: This code creates a load balancer resource that is listening on port 80.
    ```
        {
        "apiVersion": "2016-03-30",
        "name": "[variables('lbName')]",
        "type": "Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers",
        "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
        "dependsOn": [

            "publicIPAddress": {
            "id": "[variables('publicIPAddressID')]"
            }
            }
        }
        ],
        "backendAddressPools": [
        {
            "name": "[variables('lbBEAddressPool')]"
        }
        ],
        "loadBalancingRules": [
        {
            "name": "weblb",
            "properties": {
            "frontendIPConfiguration": {
            "id": "[variables('lbFEIPConfigID')]"
            },
            "backendAddressPool": {
            "id": "[variables('lbBEAddressPoolID')]"
            },
            "probe": {
            "id": "[variables('lbWebProbeID')]"
            },
            "protocol": "Tcp",
            "frontendPort": 80,
            "backendPort": 80,
            "enableFloatingIP": false
            }
        }
        ],
        "probes": [
        {
            "name": "[variables('lbWebProbeName')]",
            "properties": {
            "protocol": "Http",
            "port": 80,
            "intervalInSeconds": 15,
            "numberOfProbes": 5,
            "requestPath": "/"
            }
        }
        ]
        }
        },
    ```

5.  Add the virtual machine scale set to the **resources** section using
    the following configuration:
    ```
    {
       "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets",
       "apiVersion": "2017-03-30",
